Airdrie failed to win the last play off place as Stranraer also won.
We did however finish higher than Albion Rovers

Ayr were already in the play off and the game ment little to them.

We score early again this week. Lithgow headed a corner kick against the post.
Ayr failed to clear and it broke to Lithgow again, this time to his feet 7 yards out 
in a crowded area and he rifled it home.

Shortly afterwards Mackin( on loan from Motherwell) was played through, one on one 
with the keeper and kept his cool and fired one into the top left hand corner.

We heard at H-T that Stranraer were 0-0 and Albion Rovers were winning 2-0. If stayed like that we would be in the play off.

Rovers scored again and if they got one more they would overtake us on goal difference and take the play off spot away from us.
Almost immediately we scored again throu' another centre half Crighton.

Stranraer had scored too, so we had to hope Cowdenbeath would equalise to send us into the play off byt it was not to be.

This is the last time we will see many of these players as we are moving to a full time setup next season, with low wages.
The part time players with jobs will not be doing this.
