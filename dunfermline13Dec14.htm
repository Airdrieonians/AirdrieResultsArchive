I was in the pie queue when I heard a cheer. It turned out to be an Airdrie goal. Bryne Prunty.
They could have waited until I got to my seat before scoring. That's a bit rude.

This is the first time I have seen midfielder Ross Docherty. We got him from Livingston Mr Downie said.
He played well. 

Dunfermline had the best of the first half after going one down.
They were very physical, with the referee being very poor and not punishing them.

They had one very good chance. We did have a great chance too, when Lister should have scored in a 6 yard melee.

Early in the second half we scored a great goal. Penetrating cross from the left, a gaggle of players in and 
around the 6 yard box missed the ball and when it looked like the cross was too long to cause Dunfermline 
any problems, Blockley raced in unmarked on the right to shoot home.

We stopped Dunfermline from creating any good chances, then we put the game to bed with a goal from Marc Fitzpatrick,
who was playing defensive midfield. Blockley had possession of the ball near the right goal line and was closely marked,
He managed to turn and cut the ball back to the centre of the penalty area about 16 yards out and Marc F slotted home 
through a gaggle of players.

Dunfermline scored late on though from a corner through former Airdrie player Gregor Buchanan. 
But the game was already won.
