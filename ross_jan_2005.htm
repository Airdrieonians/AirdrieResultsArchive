Report:

<pre>
First quarter of the game Airdrie were on top. County came into it before the break.
Then Airdrie scored against the rn of play just before halftime.
Willie McLaren who had switch wings from the left to the right sloted home from 8 yards past
a defender and attacher and the keeper.
 
Second half was mostly county pressure. They missed a couple of sitters one came of the 
inside of the post and rolled along the line then out of play.
County scored when a free player in the box shot from 6 yards, could have been offside.
County were on top and we were hoping to hang on for a point. Then in the last minute
there was a stamsh in the box after a corner and Coyle poped up to turn and score right footed,
it came of the undersode of the bar.

The County defendered surrounded the ref, I do not know what they were claimimg for 
but No 6 McLauglin got booked for the protest

This was daylight robbery were maybe deserved a point at best.
But I am not complaining :-)
