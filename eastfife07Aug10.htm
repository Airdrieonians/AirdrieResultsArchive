This new team is one I am trying to get to know.
All part time for the first time in many seasons.
 
East fife had more chancesin the first half. no complains about them going in 1-0 up at HT.
 
one on one witht he keeper happened 3 or 4 times in the first half. our defence is wide open in the centre.
 
There goal was a low right wing unmarked cross and a simple tap in from close range.
Lovering was having troble holding a fast winger.
 
Gemmill went running throu free a defender got back to him and caught him sightly.
he took a step before diving for the floor.
Ref was taken in so He took the pen himself despite muir scoring against Aur 2 week agao with one against Ayr.
 
Too weak and couldm have been nearer the post - any ways the keeper(who was good all day) saved it.
 
HT 0-1
 
We come ourt stong in the 2nd.
get goal from close in shot from Gemmill. I think it was the defender in close attendence who scored but either way its 1-1.
 East Fife immediatly went out the other end and scored too. terrible marking - easy right wing passes to guy near enough standing on the line to tap it in.

EF score again in a bit of a break away. Mazy run in front of goal and in low at the right post - kepper got a finger to it but not enough. 1-3.

We put on lost of pressure after that.



We scored from acorner with Grant , centre half, powerfull header from 12 yrds.

Then, good high loopy cross from the right, went all the way to back post Gemmill header it back and Tony Watt(16 yrs young) came in to score.
