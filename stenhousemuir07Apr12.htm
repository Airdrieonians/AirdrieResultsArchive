Airdrie now safe from relegation and in a play off place position, all on the same day.
5 wins on the trot with no goals concedded. Best run for how long?

Sean Lynch was fortunate to find himself 8 yard out when the ball fell for him and 
hit it of a post for the 1st goal.

McLaren(on loan from Hamilton) hit the bar with a pen after Donnelly was pushed in 
the back while controlling a pass in the box. A waste of a pen.
But before Half Time an indirect freekick 20 yrds out was tapped to him to get a 
better angle round the wall and he blasted it in the top corner. That made up for 
his pen miss.

Blockley came on for Bain late on and scored a weird goal. It seemed like a weak cross.
The keeper seemed to read it wrong and left it to go out of play but it did sneek 
inside the post. All gifts welcome.

Lynch got himself stupidly sent of by handling the ball. 2 yelows equal a red and 
we will not see him next week. Blockley can fill in for him.
