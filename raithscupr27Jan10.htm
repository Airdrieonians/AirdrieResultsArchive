Raith looked fitter and stronger from the start.
We have played sat Mon and now wed.
Fitness and strength will be a factor.
 
Marc Smyth(OG from game on Monday) started what would a series of defensive mistakes by trying 
to dribble through the middfield and got caught, like taking candy from a baby. 
Big black striker Tade took the ball and out ran the defence to be one on one with the keeper, 
but luckily for us shot just over the bar.
 
Storry(Short pass-back caused pen goal last Sat) then continued in the same vein. 
He was on right touchline mid way ion his own half, deided to pas infeild a few yards to 
Trouton who was closly marked. Raith won ball before it got to Trouton, ran on played
in their No 9 (K.Smith) who shot low under robertson.
 
We managed to get back in the game with a wide freekick was flighted in and centre back 
Donnelly glanced the ball into the net.
 
Before we could go in for half time level, an unchalleged cross from the Raith left 
found Tade at back post completly on his lonesome. Easy to power header home.
 
Second half was poor, Black tried to bring on some subs to liven it up a bit. 
in  last minute Raith have attack very far left of penalty area nearly at touch line.
 Robertson comes rushing out to the guy and dives into him. Soft Pen I think.
Robertson had already been booked for pushing when Raith cheater was running away 
with the ball to waste time.
Ref decided to give him another - very soft again - off he went. McLauglin went
 in goal as all subs were used.
and made little effort to save pen.
 
Black was the target for some fans shouting for him to get to ...... "Black out" etc. 
They are really not happy. I see their point.
