The started with a minutes silence for the Nice lorry terrorist attack.

Airdrie are now full time, with a big turnover of players.
FitzPatrick/Faria/MacDonald/Stewart/Ferguson survive from last season.

K.McBride is head coach in the absence of Eddie W. Black who is recovering from a stroke.

Thistle deserved to win with more chances and more possession.

The goal was due to an embarressing lack of awareness and control from Hugo Faria,
who I can't remeber ever having a good game for Airdrie.

The Manager added Hugo to the team to replace FitzPatrick, for no good reason 
and within a few minutes he had caused the goal. He was dispossessed 20 yrds from goal,
and and Partick duly scored. The Keeper Ferguson made no attempt to save the shot.

Schmidt made a difference when he came on. He could be a mainstay in the team this season.
