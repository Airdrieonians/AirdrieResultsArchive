Stenny bossed the 1st 25 mins of this game and went 2-0 up.
1st was a great shot into the top corner from edge of the box.
2nd was a good ball into the box, they won it with a jumping header,
and the lay off fell well for the stiker  to score.

We were not making chances, but it was good to see the return of Martin Hardie in midfield.
Eventually we did make a chance, and as a few shots rebounded in the box, it fell to D.Sinclair
(our best player) to fire it in of the underside of the bar from 18 yrds. 
His 1st competitive goal for the club.

Our 2nd then came from a speculative low drive from Nathen Blockley which managed to evade the keeper.

We cheekily got in front with a 3rd just on Half Time. A bit of a stamash from a corner and M O'Byrne
was left with the ball at his feet 2 yards out. He didn't miss. The scoreboard gave it to Lister, 
but we knew better.

Chris O'Neill managed to get himself sent off, along with the guy he was grapling with on the ground.

In the 2nd half we seemed to have clinched it when a great run by Jamie Bain in the box, saw him 
brought down for a certain penalty, but the ball ran to L Coult who cooly rounded the keeper to score.

Nerves set in when Stenny got one back towards the end, but we saw out the game to head on to the 
2nd round of the league cup.

P.S. Rangers lost to Forfar at station park today, so no chance of getting them in Round 2.
