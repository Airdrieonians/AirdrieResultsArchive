


 

Still shell-shocked from Sat. I’ll be at El Buckfastio.

 

I met Jim Ballantyne in the board room.

Asked about Steve Findley becoming manager – I didn’t know.

Manger is on a salary.

 

He says we only have 3 loans at the moment MacGregor is our player.

 

We scored 1st, trip on Scott Stewart our best player just outside the box.

Ref gave it -  Conroy Scored.

 

Ferguson had a dropsy – they scored their 1st.

Luke Watt, all at sea, bundled the guy over in the box. Pen –their 2nd.

Macintosh short with backpass 3-1

Can’t remember the 4th

Luke Watt (Right back-What!?) got hooked at half time, John Higgins came on, who can actually defend.

 

2 similar goals in 2nd half, a long ball -  MacGregor jumps and stretches to head away, only succeeds in heading it towards his own goal, thereby playing the striker, who was in an offside position, onside, one on one with keeper and there was only going to be one outcome.

 

7th was a simple through ball, striker reacted first and scores.

 

Watt ,Ferguson, MacIntosh were our worst in that order.

Best were Scott Stewart and Willie Furtado.

 

23Aug13 RANGERS 0 – 6 [last time we lost by 6]

05Nov11 Albion Rovers     2 – 7 [last time we conceded 7]

Hi Jim,

 

Had a look at some of Lesley's posts yesterday and I think that Airdrie should employ you, as you are obviously an expert on "de-fence". OK that was a terrible attempt at humour. But us Airdrie fans need to be as upbeat as possible - I assume you have been getting stick from all other fans today!

 

See you at El Buckfastico on Saturday?

Hi Jim,

 

Good to hear from you ??

 

I'm sure whatever "the bumps" were, they will become funny anecdotes when you let me know the details...or after a few glasses of wine!

 

Hope you are having stress free commutes to and from "D" (thought it was better not to mention the proper name)

 

Enjoy the game tonight - watch out for the parking restrictions! I am unable to go as Sadie is in hospital with a severe chest infection, although they think that antibiotics and steroids will have her on the mend fairly quickly.

 

Thanks for your full address and I hope you are fully connected to the wide world in the next few days.

 

Regards

Hi Ian,

 

I’m back at work for a few days as there are no workies needing access to the house at this time.

A few bumps along the way be we have made it to the new house.

60 Woodpecker Crescent, Dunfermline KY11 8QB.

It’s so hard to right the D word everytime, it makes me shudder…

 

I have no internet, so no personal emails can be read.

Work is my only window on the world at the moment.

 

Regards

Jim

Hi Jim,

 

Hope everything remains on track for a smooth house move.

 

Was unable to send updates from Raith game as Sadie is still using my mobile. (Will be the same again this Saturday)

 

Raith Summary

We played not to get beat (4-5-1) and it might have worked had Ferguson not dropped a corner and dived over a shot!

Raith were able to influence the game by using effective subs, we had nobody of note on the bench. Suspect the size of Raith's squad will see them comfortably win the league, although I still think that Arbroath are the best team that I have seen.

 

Regards
