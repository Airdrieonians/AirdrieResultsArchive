Airdrie just about deserved a win in this tight affair.

Chris Craig in the only start I have seen him in, was well worth his place.
He took his goal well from 8 yrs in a crowded box.
He also hit the post when it seemed certain he would score.

Steve McKeown has returned to sign for Airdrie again after a number of years away
notably at Partick Th.

Other strangers in the team are Hill, a young defender at right centre back and 
Dave Gray wide left.

Ridgers almost gifted Peterhead a goal when he ran way outside the box to close 
down an on running striker, giving him an easy opportunity to lob the ball over
him, but failed to score as it bounced wide.
This is on the back of Ridgers gifting Morton a goal at Broomfield in the cup tie,
by running out to clear a thro' ball and having a fresh air clearance. Morton
stiker took the gift greatfully.
