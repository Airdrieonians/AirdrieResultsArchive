Only 4 of the starting 11 have survived from last season. Lots of new faces and a new chairman.

We only created 3 of 4 chances in the whole game, with Stirling mainly having long range shots.

A cross from the right found its way to the left edge of the area, Jordon Morton slide it on to his 
weaker right foot to find room to score.

Stirling did have a great chance in the last few minute to score from 5 yards with an angled 
shot from the right side, but lack of composure (or blind panic) ended with a sky bound effort.

This may be Manager Gary Bollan's first win in a cup tie for Airdrie.
