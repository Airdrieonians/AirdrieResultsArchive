Great game. Best for years
Hamilton Accies youth players R.Tierney,J.McGregor & 
Motherwell youth players L.Watt,J.Hastie, all worth their place.

Balantoni played as Trialist(very slow, he will cost us goals 
if we do not get rid of him, and nearly did again today as last week v Albion Rovers)
and I don't know the name of the other Trialist who was black and great.

R.Ferguson has signed for Motherwell and has been loaned back to us, 
saving another wage and with the rumoured £20k we got from Dunfermline 
for Andy Ryan who scored again today for the Pars, we may have some cash.

We have signed Tom Fry who has played 3 times for us as a Trialist.

Fitzpatrick seemed to be in charge on the bench after W.Aitchison's sacking last week.

We got a soft penalty and Conroy squeezed it past the keeper.

Alloa hit the post in their best chance of an evan 1st half.

In the 2nd half we destroyed them with great flicks, back heals(from Trialist) and 
magnificent movement and fast inter passing.

We should have buried them long since, with a great shot hitting the post, but in 
the end after they had committed all 3 subs and then got an injury, to go down to 10 men,
 we pounced with a great long ball to Jake Hastie ( who is a whippet by the way) who went 1 on 1 with 
the keeper and bust the net. I was starting to worry that all our pressure would come
 to nought and we would get punished for not scoring when we were on top.

Big smiles all round :-)
