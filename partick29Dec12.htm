We held on to a point against the league leaders despite getting pummilled 
for most of the game.

We started well and scored first, with John Boyle on the right mid in box,
driving it right inside the left post from 15 yrds. 
My Cousin's son Greame Smith was in goal fro Partick.

Parick had most of the game thereafter and missed some great chances, 
skying most of them from inside the box.

But they eventually scored.

They then stepped it up and put on the pressure even more, but we managed 
to keep them out to grab a great point.
