Playing 2nd place Partick who could still win league.
A win would clinch play-off, and avoid automatic relegation.
Clyde won 2-0, but it did not matter in the end.

Lynch comes off the bench late on.
high ball over the Partick defence, McLauchlin runs on to it.
He is on his lonsome, holds it up waiting for support.
Gos left of side of box and waits for Lynch sprinting in.
He could have shot himself but did not have the confidence to.
Squares it accross the keeper to Lynch to tap in under pressure from chasing defender.
Big Airdrie crowd behind the goal goes wild.
Automatic relegation avoided.
