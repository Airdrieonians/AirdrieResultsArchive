<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="4">However Clydebank FC were in administration and looking for a buyer. They had disgraced themselves by being one of the Parcel of Rogues who voted to kill Airdrie United's chances of joining the 3rd Division. Jim Ballantyne the chairman of Airdrie United offered to buy Clydebank for £160,000 if the League Management Committee would agree to let him change the name of Clydebank to Airdrie United, change the strip to an Airdrieonians strip and play league games at New Broomfield, the former Airdrieonians stadium. This was agreed. So Airdrie United can take Clydebank's place in the 2nd Division. Justice at last!
