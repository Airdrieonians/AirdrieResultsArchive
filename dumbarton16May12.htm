Airdrie set up a chance to win the Promtion Play off Final at home on Sunday in an entertaining game.


Airdrie had the best of the 1st half and looked more threatening and had more chances.

Then against the run of play Dumbarton went 2 up.
Prunty(former Airdrie player and grew up in Airdrie) scored with a good finish from 12 yrds.
Then Wallace scored with a free header from a left wing free kick.

Airdrie got one back when Stephenson was barged in the back in the box.
Lovering missed our last spot kick, so Jamie Bain took this one and missed too.
But he did put the rebound in the roof of the net.

H-T 1-2

2nd half we were even more on top than the first.
Dumbarton defended well and broke quickly.
They are a counter attaking team with a good defence.
Good mobility too.

Game was live on BBC ALBA.
