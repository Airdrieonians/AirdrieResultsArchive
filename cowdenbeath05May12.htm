Airdrie clinched the last play off place position with a goaless draw against 
the champions Cowdenbeath.
7 wins and this draw in the last 9 games, is the run required to nip in 
the playoff by a point.

We  now play Ayr from the 1st Div above in the play off semi finals.

Cowdenbeath had 2 great chances, poor finishing cost them the game.
We hit the bar and had some decent efforts but were fortunate to get a point.

In the end the result of this game did not matter as Stenhousemuir who could 
have taken the last play off place from us managed to lose at home to Forfar 
who needed points to aviod a relegation play off place, which now goes to 
Albion Rovers.

Fans with radios or mobile phone data were telling us how Forfar were ahead,
then they got pegged back then went ahead again.
We needed to match Stenny's result to remain in 4th.

Big changes in our team selection today due to suspensions.
Top league scorer (with 21 goals), Ryan Donnelly, Jamie Bain and on loan Willie McLaren absent.

Paul Lovering did not play either.
