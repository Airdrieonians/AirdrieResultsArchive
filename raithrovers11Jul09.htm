Scott Gemmell missed a sitter in our only real chance of the game.
Raith scored a pen just before H-T.
Midfeild Trialist was good. tall thin,Striker trialist never made an impression &
was taken off with head knock after 30 mins.
Our best player was Darren Smith.

Watt and a number of fringe players came on near the end.
