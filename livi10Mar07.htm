Starting Line up:

         Potter     Marc Smyth     Neil McGowan   Paul Lovering

    Procter     Kevin Macdonald, Steve McKenna, Graham Holmes
                (Stuart Taylor)

Mad Ref Boyle(remembered for sending off McPhee(and Stanraer striker) 
at Stranraer in the 2nd Div) gave Livi soft pen then sent off Livi centre 
half (for stamp on Prunty) and then midfielder for two footed lunge at 
McGowen. We then put more pressure on. Holmes scored from 6 yards in 
crowded area(only thing he did all day), Taylor came off bench to turn 
and shoot from 12 yards into roof of net, Procter scored in last minute 
from right side. John Robertson Livi boss made point of shaking hand with 
all Airdrie Players and walking away before doing so with Ref.
