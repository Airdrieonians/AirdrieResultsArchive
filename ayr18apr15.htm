Att: 881


Ayr played well and had 2 great chances. Craig Beattie(former Hearts and Scotland striker) 
was the culprit for them both.

We had some pressure on the Ayr goal but their defence played well.

In the 2nd half we were better and created some chances of our own.

In the last 10 mins we scored two great goals.
1st a quick brake up field involving Fraser resulted in McHugh (who is a recent starter to 
try to replace injured Jim Lister - on loan)
who was wide right of the penalty area shooting home.

2nd was a free kick just outside the area won by Jamie Bain, who had one of his better games. 
McHugh was totally unmarked to head home.
He should have had a hat trick when he managed to hit a defender on the line from 6 yrs.

This damages Ayr's attempt to avoid a relegation play off and leaves us with 6 pts to make 
up on Brechin with 2 games remaining for a promotion pay off place.
A bit of a tall order.
