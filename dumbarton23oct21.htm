Most dramatic game I have seen for years.
We won 3-0 at Falkirk last time out so Ian & I expected a win.
    
    We get an early Pen and Rhys McCabe scores from it.
    
Dumbarton then get a series of graet chances and pass them all up.
    They eventually do score.
    
    We are toiling. We need to change something.
    All the midfielders are small. Dumbarton had airel advantage at corneres etc.
    
In 2nd half we get another pen, Rhys McCabe doesn't get near post nad good hiehgt for the save.
Dumbarton piced up lots of bookings, some for time wasting and they they were always mouthing off the ref.
    This came back to haught them when they got their No 11 sent off.
    No 5 got a 2nd yellow fro dragging back our attacker, running in on goal.
    No 8 got a 2nd yellow for holding back a defender in the box.
    Surely we can win while paying a team of 8.
    We huffed and puffed and it looked like we could not make the break throught until,
    Dylan EASTONs wonder strike , long range effort flew in.
    He had had a poor game up to then , giving the ball away a lot.
    
    Celebrations were mad. 
    
    Then as the ref played out the remaining added time,
    Dumbaton score a tap in with our defence nowhere.
    We have blown it!
    
    Then in the last minite possibly from or after a corner,
    Aissa scored a header in a challenge with the kepper.
    He takes his top of and run about like he had won the world Cup.
    His 1st ever goal for Airdrieonians.
    
    Dumbarton manager gets sent off too.
    
    What a great game.
    :-)
