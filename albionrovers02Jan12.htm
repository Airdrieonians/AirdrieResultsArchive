Tight game. Even 1st half, 2 chances each, in a dower encounter.
2nd half we were much improved and had half a dozen good chances.
There would have been a pen each but the ref Conroy strangly
 did not want to know.

Lovering had a great shot saved the keeper from 10yrds.

Stephenson's winner was a great volley from just inside the box,
curled in low to the keepers left through a ruck of players.

Stephenson could hardly complete a pass for most of the game.
He looked like he was having a mare before he scored.

Strange team selection.
right back Bain playing right midfield,
Stephenson moved to left midfield,
Winger McLaren playing right up front.
Good to see young Blockley and Green getting a game.
