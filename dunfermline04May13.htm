Dunfermline needed to win to be sure of staying in the 1st Div, with Cowdenbeath chasing them.
Losing out would mean a play-off. We are of course are already doomed.

They had lost 7 first team players when they went into administration and got docked 15 pts.

Dunfermline had numerous chances. They hit the bar twice and the post.
Short of a recognised striker, they missed a number of sitters.

We go ahead with youth player Liam COOGANS scoring his first goal for the club, 
by nipping in behind the defence to score off the inside of the post.
Looked a tad offside, but who cares?

Dunfermline get one back, then MacLaren comes on as Sub and with his first touch he brings 
the ball down 30 yrds out. His second touch rifles a great shot low into the corner of the net.

"See you next Year, See you next Year" was the chant from the 90 Airdrie fans,

Our first points this quarter. Our worst season on record with 22 pts.
