Dumbaton scored from a great free kick in first half after 16mins
Lovering gave away the free by deliberatly bundling over a striker

We seemed to be the better team for most of the 1st half but did not trouble the keeper.

2nd half we came out like a storm.
Dumbarton weathered it and hit on the break well a few times.
Big vocal support from Dumbarton travelling support.



late on Owens was replaced by Stevenson.
Owens not too happy went straight up the tunnel, ignoring Lawrence's signal to come and sit on the bench.
Owens head getting to big? after Boyle said he was too good for the 2nd division.
Well he did not play well today and had a woful free kick shot on goal.

Sally came on for Gemmell who had been booked and was not effective since then.
Almost Sally's first touch was to head the ball into an empty net from 6 yrs, when the keeper made a mistake 
and failed to intecept a weak cross.

Not content with a point we continued to press the game.

A near post stamash and poor keeping again I would say left Morton with a tap in.

Great relief to get a win we deserved when it looked like out lack of striking talent would cost us the game.

we are free of relegation worries before the game today and now we can think of putting pressure on to get a playoff place.
