Great game to start league season.

Very open, loads of chances. Dumbarton had a lot of possession hit the bar twice.
Keast ran down the left wing to the by line and crosses long and Phil Johnstone the right winger ran in to score.
This goal was replayed with 25 mins to go and worked again.

Ryan DONNELLY's goal was a shot which hit the post and he nodded it in from 1 yd out.
