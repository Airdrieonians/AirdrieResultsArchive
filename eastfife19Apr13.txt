Airdrie clintched their survival with this win against the team below them in the league.

Fairly even game.

McAleer good finsh from the right edge of the 6 yrd box, across the keeper We thought he would cut it back.

Buchanan and Watt scored too but were ruled out for offside and a foul.

Lister's was fine strike at the near post after making himself space close to McAleers scoring position.
