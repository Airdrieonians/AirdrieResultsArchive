Report:

Marv scored a cracking goal by dribbling at the right edge of the area, cutting inside and <br>hitting a shot with his left. Marv never scores and canny dribble - what a shock to us all.

Martin Hardie is a former Thistle player and is impeded by the ref at the left edge of the area. <br>after a hesitation he tries to curle it inside the keepers left post. It hits the post and <br>rebounds to the middle of the area. Who is there but Oweny to slide it in.

Hardie takes some stick from Thistle fans and shows them a fist salute after the goal.

Hardie later goes in over the ball and drags his studs down the boys shin and ankle.
I rekon Red, Ref lets him off with yellow. Thistle player gets streachered off.

They score from a corner a minute before half time.

H-T: 2-1

Early in half Thislte guy gos very hard, jumping 2 footed into Hardie at half way line.
All hell brakes loose Airdrie players sprint to scene of crime, big mellie.
Ref gets set to red card the bady. Some other Thistle tumshie manhandles the ref. 
Ref sends manhandler off, then sends bady off. Then books Christie for sprinting 40 yards
<br>to get involved. What a laugh!

11 vs 9.

Lots of hard Thistle tackles -  2 more booked.

Good cross from the right by Barkey and the ball somehow bounces through a ruck of players to <br>McLaren to tap in at the back post.

We get sloppy and they score when the forward muscles out our defender inside the box to shoot.

Scary thought of losing points banished when another Barkey cross from the right is met by 
<br>Coyle on the penalty spot. Thank God,  4-2.

Coyle has now notched 5 league goals this season, 4 against Thistle. Apparently he scored 
<br>one for Dundee Utd to relegate Thistle a few seasons back. Thistle fans dispise him.

Best game this season by a mile!
