Airdrie lost on penalties, in a game they should have won.
2-1 up with 5 mins to go when sub keeper miskicks a clearence and 
rushes out to close down Gemmell who overhead kicks it past the keeper into the net.

Watt opened the scoring with a move you could see would end in a goal.
Movement down the right wing, a great cross into the box by Gray with 2 players waiting for 
it and Rovers defence thin on the ground. Watt scored with a header close in at the back post.

Rovers scored with a sharp shot, when there seemed no danger, from the edge of the box.

What we all thought was the winner came from Blockley. A floated cross from the right 
caught the defence out and Blockley found himself just inside the area. Their keeper 
started to come out and Blockley cleverly tried a first touch header to lob the keeper.
Keeper did get to it, but Blockley followed up to dive a header into the net from 1 yard.
Reminded me of Van Persie's headed goal vs Spain in the World Cup last month.

Extra time and pens resulted in our elimination from the Challange Cup.

Good to see John Boyle return after about 18 month out with injury and Sandy Stewart was 
at the game watching his son Scott play. Also Sandy Clark was in the Albion Rovers dugout 
as assistant manager. His boss Darren Young was playing midfield and scored the winning pen.
