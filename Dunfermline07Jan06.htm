Docherty(2),
Hardie,
McKeown(P)

Dunfermline's Hunt(man of the match) dribbled through the defence and shot - Airdrie 
keeper palms it upwards and 2 forwards were waiting to score from 6 yards. McGowan 
tries to head clear with a diving header 12 yards out it hits McKenna and rebounds 
to Hunt who scored easily in less than 30 mins. It looked like being a 5-0 hammering
 at this point. Before half time Docherty scored a headed goal from a free kick to 
give us hope. We were 2-1 down at half time.

The second half was a drama. A great move down the left lead to McPhee playing the ball 
round a defender and ran round him on the edge of the area but Hardie was rushing on 
to it and took it on and scored with a great finish. Great! 2-2 and a replay at 
Broomfield. The Ref was very poor and started making mad decisions, the keeper had the
 ball in his hands and was barged into by a forward and he dropped the ball and 
Dunfermline scored. The Ref was happy for this goal to stand -disgrace. Makel then 
got sent off for a 2nd bookable offence. Airdrie pressed hard for the last 15 mins. 
We scored and the ref chopped it of for a reason we do not know. Dunfermline keeper 
trying to waste time by holding the ball while behind the byline, Airdrie player 
grabbed the ball off him and the keeper struck him and through him over the advertising
 hordings. The ref amazingly only booked him. A hand ball in the box gives us a 
penalty and the culprit could have been sent off for deliberate hand ball. McKeown 
scored his 7th pen of the season in the last minute. A replay was back on and Ian 
said we should go for a winner. Within a minute Docherty scored with a close in header 
to win an incredible game. Mad Celebrations Followed....
