Final score Airdrie 1 Brechin City 1

ID Made kick-off today!
An enjoyable game which both teams will think they should have won and both sets of fans 
probably thought that referee Northcroft did not have a good game. Like the previous home 
match the experienced spine of the visiting team – Nelson, Byers and King – faced the 
never-say-die attitude of the energetic and youthful Diamonds.
 It was no surprise when Byers stepped inside Lovering and opened the scoring with a 
curling shot into the top corner. Had McAllister not missed a one on one chance five 
minutes later the game could have turned out very differently. But as half time 
approached the work rate of the entire Airdrie team was beginning to wear down Brechin’s 
resistance. And eight minutes into the second half a corner, which was not dealt with, 
allowed Gibson an easy headed equaliser. McAllister was then sent off for a second bookable
 offence (a lunge at the goalie) and Airdrie took control with two headed chances being 
missed by Gemmill and Devlin. But with about ten minutes to go Gibson picked up his second 
yellow and an end to end finish followed. McCord and Watt going closest for Airdrie.
Airdrie finished with Devlin and Stallard in central defence – total football!
