We played great but just could not score. Ayr were a strong team and controlled a 
lot of the game especially in the first half.

Bain scored a great curling shot from the edge of the area. The ref gave the goal.
Then the linesman flaged for high feet before the goal. Goal was chalked off.

Donnelly went an a strong run into the box and was obstructed. Ref gave a pen (Bit soft).
Lovering hit it down the middle , but was not high enough and the keeper saved.
I thought Jamie Stevenson should have taken it.

Donnely had an over head kick go just over and hit the bar with a  curling shot.
MacDonald hit the post late on too.

Nathan Blockley played great. Best I've seen him. I think he is only 19 years old.

Ayr had few chances, despite their good play.

We were missing W.McLaren, who should be back for the 2nd leg.

Former Airdrie men Mark Roberts and Troughton both played for Ayr.
