Att: 437 - lowest in Airdrie's history!

Airdrie played well and created numerous chances. 
The best we have played for a long while.

At least 4 personell changes from Sat. Fareweather deservedly kept 
his place after comming on as sub on Sat. Johnstone comes back in and 
Donnelly makes a rare apperance. Blockey is a player I have never heard 
of, but he played well enough. We did have a problem with a defensive 
midfielder as both Devlin and  McKeown are both suspended after being 
sent off in seperate games.

We hit the bar in the 1st half, as well an anumber of other chances.
Forfar had 2 great chances of there own which they let slip bye.

we scored 2 in the 2nd half.
Johnstone raced on down the right on a break away and outstriped his 
full back and for once put in a good low cross. Donnelly was there 
streaching in front of the keeper to guide it home.

2nd goal was made by Jamie Stevenson. He cut in from the left and 
crossed but it deflected off the shins of a defender and spun up in 
the air, over the keeper and Gemmill was standing on the line and let 
it hit off his head to score.
