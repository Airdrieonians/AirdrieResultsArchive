Att: 547

Forfar had more chances and should probably have won.
We got a point from a Nick Cadden Rocket from outside the box.

Former Airdrie manager Gary Bollan was in the Forfar dugout
 and our manager Eddie Black is in the Western General Hospital, Edinburgh
 with a stroke he suffered at half time in the game Sat past.

We persist with the one stiker formation which I think is wrong.

The lowest attendance I can ever remember at Airdrie.
