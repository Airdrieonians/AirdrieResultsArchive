Att: 1005

Airdrie win with very late goal from sub Willie McLaren.

With full back in attendance McLaren homes in on goal and slots a low one accross 
the keeper hitting the side net.

Not sure we deserved it with only a Blockley 30 yard effort and a 
Boyle floated effort, to show for our efforts.

Hamilton had 2 or 3 better chances but could not convert

Lots of new players for us to have a look at.
Both full backs and both wid midfeilders were new. as was the return of Di Gacimo.
New keeper too.
