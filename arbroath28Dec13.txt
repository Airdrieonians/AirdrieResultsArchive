Looked like it was going to be another defeat to add to the 7 and 1 draw in the last 8, 
when Arbroath scored a header from a right wing free kick, which was as good as a corner.

In the 2nd half, we scored from a corner from Gregor Buchanan, who scored from a corner in the last game too.
Thats only the 3rd league goal I have seen this season, only 2nd at home.
I saw Keiren Parker play as a Trialist for us in the last home game vs East Fife.
This time he mnaged to get an easy goal. Jamie Bain shot from the edge of the box, keeper parried it
(everything was bouncing off him today), straight to Lister who shot and it came right back to his feet,
He then squared it to Parker to score a tap in.
