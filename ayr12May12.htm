Airdrie clinched a place in the Promtion Play off Final in an entertaining game at Somerset park.

Ayr had a player sent off after 20 mins for a 2 footed foul on Lambie.
A red was a bit harsh I thought.

H-T 0-0

Series of shots inside the box, Ayr could not clear properly.
Jamie BAIN shot, it hit a ruck of players and then a secondary shot flew into the net.
It could not be seen from the stand who scored. It turned out to be D.HOLMNES.

Ayr then scored 10 mins later after a free kick was floated in and poor marking allowed them to score.

We immediately went up the park. S.Donnelly then weaved round a defender at the right edge of the box
and gave a slide rule pass to D.HOLMNES to knock the ball home.

Ayr were pushing forward towards the end and that gave us a chance to break quickly.
Blockley put through W.MCLAREN to go one on one with the keeper and score.

Mass exodus of Ayr fans followed.
