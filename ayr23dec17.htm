Best victory of the season against the league leaders.
We played the 2nd best team in the league in our last home 
game and achieved a creditable draw, live on BBC ALBA.

Ian McCall is Ayr manager, formally manager of Airdrie.

We scored really early. We pressed them at the edge of the 
area and lost possession to a good steal from Ayr defence who 
promptly left it to each other and Cammy Russell calmly took
possession and shot across the keeper to score on low into the corner.

Ayr then went on to dominate the first half possession.
Ferguson had one great save when the striker went straight through.

Towards half time we won a series of corners and Cammy Russell put over a long 
cross for Brownlie to leap salmon like above all the surrounding defenders 
to head the ball towards the ground , it bounced high just over the line before 
a defender hooked it clear. Ref was closest and gave the goal, the linesman 
didn't give anything.

Second half we played slow and tried to keep Ayr out.
They did ahave a couple of good chances, and should have scored.
But possession states do not win games - goals do..
