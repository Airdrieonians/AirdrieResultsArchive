After Extra Time. (FT 3 -3)

Att: 935 [Airdrie fans = 120]

Airdrie lose narrowly to a better Raith side.
We score first. Josh Watt (tricky winger on Loan from Motherwell) cut inside 
from the right and lashes a left foot shot in from the edge of the area.

They score almost immediatly. Poor work by Warren to allow the cross and Evans
has been left standing as the striker scores from the 6yd box, right in the centre of the goal.

They then get a soft Pen when Blockley bundles into a Raith player(who is facing away from goal)
in the box.

We then get a Pen for something I did not see, It was at the opposite goal from the Airdrie fans.
Paul Di Gaicomo scored down the middle for the pen.

10 mins into the 2nd half. They score again -  a drive from the right edge of the box.
Duncan has replaced Kenny Arther in goal by now who left with what looked like a hamstring strain.

Last chance in normal time as we look to be heading to a 2-3 defeat. Willie McLaren takes a free 
kick from just outside the area and floats it to the back post where Gregor Buchanan streaches to 
reach it and head it home.

We are now heading for Extra Time.

It only takes then 10 Mins to score the winner from a corner.
Raith head it towards goal, don't know who else it hit before the net.
